# VECTORIZATION

' to compute non-vectorized wT * x '

z = 0
for i in range(n - x):
	z += w[i] * x[i]
z += b

' vectorizing it '

z = np.dot(w, x) + b

GPU -> PARALLELIZATION INSTRUCTIONS SIMD (SINGLE INSTRUCTION MULTIPLE DATA)
CPU -> SIMD, so using functions like np.dot(), you let numpy do the function without the for loop, taking better advantage of parallelism

#SO, WHENEVER POSSIBLE, AVOID EXPLICIT FOR LOOPS
