Deep learning introduction repository

## Introduction

This rep contains all my work for this specialization. All the code base, quiz questions, screenshot, and images, are taken from, unless specified, [Deep Learning Specialization on Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning).

## Set Up

**Use pip to install and update packages, if you dont have python, download it [here](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/)!**

- Python 3 (i recomend Python 3 >=3.4)
- Jupyter click [here](http://jupyter.org/install) to install and run our codes!
- Numpy
- TensorFlow for python
- Matplotlib

## DL repository for newbies, that will have

- [text files](https://github.com/bielrossi15/deep-learning-101/tree/master/texts) to understand DL maths and theory
- [jupyter notebooks](https://github.com/bielrossi15/deep-learning-101/tree/master/jupyter) with examples of certain implementations
- ANN, CNN, RNN



**Deep learning from newbie to newbies, enjoy!**
