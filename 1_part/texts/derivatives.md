# COMPUTATION DERIVATIVE GRAPHS
< You use a lot of chain rule >

**J = 3v**
**v = a + u**
**u = bc**
a = 5, b = 3, c = 2

<so> 
**dJ/dv = 3**
**dv/da = 1**
< and, at the end of our line going back to a, we get >

**dJ/da = dJ/dv * dv/da = 3**

< because J(v) and v(a, u), so J(v(a, u)), making us use the chain rule >

< using b >
**dj/du = dj/dv * dv/du = 3**
**dJ/db = dJ/du * du/db = 6**
**dJ/dc = dJ/du * du/dc = 9**

< The notation that we use, is this one >

**dFinalOutputVar/dvar = dJdVar**
