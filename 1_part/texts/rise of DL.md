# RISE OF DL

- Rising amount of data in the past 10 years

- NN gets better and better with more data and more neurons

- NN dont behave like ML algorithms (svm, regressions, etc), since they grow based on how much data you give them

- Scale is the key word, both the size of your NN and the data (more data = more reliable)

- Amout of training examples(data) = m

- Hardware
