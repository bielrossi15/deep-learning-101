#### NEURAL NETWORKS INTRODUCTION

NN works with supervised learning by passing your input and output features and then they create hidden layer features, called 'NEURONS', that create mathematical equations to predict the new output

HIDEN UNITS = NEURONS

All input features are interconnected with all hidden layer features

Works best with supervised learning, giving an input X and an output Y








#### NEURAL NETWORKS APPLICATION

INPUT(X) - OUTPUT(Y) - APPLICATION

Home features - Price - Real state

Ad, user info - Click on Ad? (0/1) - Online advertising

Image - Object(0,...,1000) - Photo tagging

Audio - Text transcript - Speech recognition

English - Chinese - Machine translation

Image, Radar info - Position of other cars - Autonomous driving


#### DATA

Structured data = Datasets, data that is structured (oh, rly?)

Unstructured data = Images, Audio, Text, data that is harder for the computer understand, that dont have a pattern, unstructured
