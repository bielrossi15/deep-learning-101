#BIAS AND VARIANCE


##Explanation

**High bias (small variance)** -> Underfitting, high error percentage

**High variance (small bias)** -> Ovefitting, pretty good on your train set, but bad at your test set, because it will not generalize well, considering attributes taht dont have to be considered

**"Just right"** -> Bias and variance balanced 

##Resumes

**Train/Dev set error**
ex0 - 1/11 -> High variance (over)
ex1 - 15/16 -> High bias (under)
ex2 - 15/30-> High bias and variance
ex3 - 0.5/1 -> Low bias and variance



##BASIC ML RECIPE

**High bias?** -> check the training data performance (bigger network, train longer, different NN architecture, etc)

**High variance** -> dev set (more data, regularization, NN architecture, etc)
